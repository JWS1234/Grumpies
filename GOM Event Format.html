        <h1>Play Day</h1>
        <p>While you're enjoying a nice dinner the evening before, and a hardy breakfast before leaving for the
            golf course the next morning, someone is hard at work making <i>Play Day</i> run as smooth as possible.
            Here's what goes on.</p>

        <h2>The Day Before</h2>
        <p>A lot of work goes into getting ready for <i>Play Day</i>.
            This has to be done between the time Sign-Up ends and
            early next morning. Someone has to figure out the flights,
            the pairings and the hole assignments before
            players check in the next morning so they can give the Pro Shop
            a list of who to collect green fees from (I know - that's bad grammar).</p>
        <h3>Flights and Flight Assignments</h3>
        <p>The <i>Grumpy</i> support system allows for up to 5 "back-tee" flights
            (designated 1CH, A, B, C, and D) and 3 "forward-tee" flights (F1, F2, and F3).
            Each flight can have a maximum of 20 players so,
            theoretically, that's 80 back tee players and 60 forward tee players. However,
            most events are in the 60 to 80 player range with a few higher or lower.
            Most courses (not all) have a limit on the number of tee times they will accept so as
            not to interfere with the membership or other outside play.
            Diamond Oaks, however, does not have a limit on the number of players -
            if we play there on a Monday when the course is closed to members.
            On occasion, we will play 3 sets of tees (back, middle, and forward).
            In this case, the Championship Flight (1CH) will play the back tees and
            flights A, B, C, and D will play the middle tees. Forward-tee players
            always play the same tees (e.g. all red). </p>
        <p>A player is assigned to a flight according to his <i>index</i>. For
            example, Flight 1CH may have players whose index is up to 10.0 while the
            A-flight has players from 10.1 to 15, B-Flight from 15.1 to 19.0, etc.</p>
        <p>Unless the field is unusually
            small, there will be at least 4 or 5 flights with sizes of 12 to 16 players.
            Flights may not all be the same size - they seldom are.
            Flights are determined by art rather than craft.
            As an example, assume there are 64 players signed up making 4 flights of 16. In a perfect world, the #16
            player would have a lower handicap than the #17 player and be assigned to the Championship Flight.
            #17 would go to the A-Flight. BUT ... it seldom works out that way. #16 may be tied with 5 other players
            with the same handicap.</p>
        <p>In the end, adjustments may be made to account for widely differing flight sizes (this is
            where the art comes in). For example, if the #16 player is tied with 5 other players, it would work
            better if the Championship flight were 15 players and the 5 that tied for #16 went into the A-Flight
            bumping some of those players to the next flight.
            Or perhaps four flights of 13 and one of 12. One way or the other it
            all works out and a good time is had by all.</p>
        <h3>Pairings</h3>
        <p>An attempt is made to pair golfers in the same foursome with other golfers of a similar handicap.
            However, there are many friends in the <i>Grumpies</i> who like to play with each other even when they are
            in
            different flights with (sometimes) widely differing handicaps. Our compassionate leader (Tom) is
            sympathetic and will accommodate those who have indicated they prefer playing with one or more
            <i>friends.</i> So you might find a foursome where everyone is in a different flight.
        <p>
        <h3>Starting Hole Assignments</h3>
        <p>Having assigned flights and pairings, now it's time to make
            <i>starting hole</i> assignments. Since we always use a shotgun start, we start with hole #1 and work
            backwards. Hole #1 is usually reserved for those volunteers
            who help collect entry fees in the morning and collect score cards at the end.
        </p>
        Pairings and starting hole assignments will be posted on the web site the evening before.
        <p>Except for the Par 3s, two groups are usually assigned to the same starting hole -
            for example 16A (tees off first) and then 16B.</p>

        <h2>The Morning Of</h2>
        <p>The morning of the tournament, Tom and several <font color="red"> volunteers</font>
            will be at the clubhouse with a list of players
            for the pro shop to use when collecting green fees (and the occasional range ball fee - range balls are
            usually included with the green fee). Then they will set up at a couple of tables (usually in
            the dining area) to collect entry fees and tell players their playing partners and hole assignments.</p>

        <h3>When You Get To the Course</h3>
        <p>When you get to the course, go to the pro shop and pay your green fee, then find Tom and the boys
            and pay your entry fee. If you didn't look at the web site the night before, they will tell
            you your starting hole and playing partners (they will probably tell you anyway even
            if you don't ask). </p>
        <p>Please be sure to be there to <i><b>check in at
                    least 15 minutes before tee time.</b></i> Our tireless staff needs
            a little time to hit a few balls or maybe just a few putts. Just remember, the guys who have
            to wait for late arrivals are the same ones that determine who wins the money.</p>

        <p>The $10 prize money is allocated within flights as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Low Net - $5 <br>
                <p>Actually, this is the only contest that is not optional. So you can get away with
                    a $5 investment for the day if you opt not to participate in the next few competitions.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>So how much can you win?
                        <p>There is an elaborate payout table that determines who wins
                            and how much they win depending on the number of players in the flight.
                            For example, if you're interested
                            (who isn't?) you can find it on the <i>Money</i> page.
                            Just click on it at the top of the page.</p>
                        <p>As an example, if there are 15 players in a flight, that's $75. That money is paid to
                            the top 4 players in the amounts of $35, $25, $10, and $5. Ties are broken by assigned
                            with the oldest player winning out. Age is determined by birthday - not just
                            "I'm 76 but so is he." Unless they have the same birthday, the tie will be broken.
                            For all other competitions, the money is split.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Gross Skins - $3 - optional</li>
            <p>Not much to explain here. If you have the lowest score in your flight
                on any hole, you win a <i>skin.</i>
                How much you win depends on how many in your flight opted to play in this competition.</p>
            <li>Closest to the Pin - $2 - optionally</li>
            <p>There is a CTP competition for every Par 3. One winner for each Par 3.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>Low Gross - $5</h2>
            <p>You may optionally pay an additional $5 and enter the Low Gross competition
                for each flight. As its name implies, the $5 goes into a pot which is split
                among the two low gross finishers in each flight (1st = 2/3 ; 2nd = 1/3). Ties are split. </p>
            <h3>Hole in One Club(s)</h2>
                <p>There are actually two <i>Hole in One</i> competitons.
                <ol>
                    <li>The first was established many moons ago and did not cost anything to participate in.
                        It was (and still is) funded by a variety of means. For example, if two people tie
                        for an odd number of dollars (e.g. $9) then each would get $4 and the
                        extra dollar goes to fund it. Everybody is eligible at no cost.
                    </li>
                    <li>The second costs $5 and is optional. To participate, pay the <i>Grumpies</i> at the
                        sign-in desk $5. This money goes into a pot which gets paid out to the
                        first player to record a hole in one, at which
                        time you get to (optionally) pay another $5 for the next hole in one.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Your winnings will be held for you until the next time you play and sign in.
                    It will be held for 60 days at which time it will go into the Hole in One pot. If you know
                    you will be gone for 60+ days, notify Tom Moore and he will see that it is held
                    until you return.</p>

                <h2>Pace of play</h2>
                <p>It is our goal to play 18 holes in no more than 4h 15m. Besides this being a
                    very reasonable time to play in, the course will have scheduled tee times right behind us. If we
                    are slow, then those tee times will not be able to start until our
                    last group has passed the 1st tee. So if we are too slow getting past the 1st tee
                    too often, we may not be welcome back. </p>

                <h2>Rules of Golf</h2>
                <p>We play by the <i>USGA Rules of Golf</i> but, considering our age, trying to make the game more
                    fun, and to improve the speed of play, there
                    are a few exceptions to those rules. For example, some flights may play preferred lies in the
                    fairway or there is a maximum of double par on any hole.
                    These rule exceptions are explained in detail on the Rules page.</p>
