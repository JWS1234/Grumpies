        <h1>Tournament Details</h1>
        <h2>Entry Fee</h2>
        <p>An entry fee of $10 will be collected at the course prior to our tee time. Please be sure to
            be there to pay at <i><b>least 15 minutes before tee time.</b></i> Our glorious staff needs
            a little time to hit a few balls or at least a few putts.</p>
        <p>The $10 Prize money is allocated as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>$5 for Low Net <br>
                A <i><b>minimum of 1/3</b></i> of the field gets paid. If there are 15 players in a flight,
                then 5 players get paid. If there are 16 players, then 6 get paid.
            </li>
            <li>$3 for Gross Skins</li>
            <li>$2 for Closest to Pin</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Odd dollars and cents are put into the Hole in One fund. For example,
            if there are 16 players in a flight (that's $48 for gross skins) and if there are 5 skins,
            the payout per skin will be $48/5 = $9 plus $3 left over which will go
            to the Hole in One pot.
        </p>
        <p>Your winnings will be held for you until the next time you play and sign in.
            It will be held for 60 days at which time it will go into the Hole in One pot. If you know
            you will be gone for 60+ days, notify Tom Moore and he will see that it is held
            until you return.</p>

        <h2>When do we play?</h2>
        <p>Tournaments are played
            every Monday and Wednesday throughout the year except when
            it conflicts with a holiday or bad weather. On Mondays we usually play Waterchase
            and Wednesday we play any one of a dozen or more other courses in the area.
            Tee times are early in the morning depending on
            the time of year - typically 7:30 in the summer, 8:00 in the early spring and late fall,
            and 8:30 in the winter. Tee times may change based on the weather conditions or by request of
            the golf course.</p>
        <h2>What do we play?</h2>
        <p>Based on your handicap, you will be slotted into a <b>flight</b> with players that have similar
            handicaps. Flights are typically 12-16 players although this may vary depending on the
            number of players signed up. You will usually play in a threesome or foursome with players in
            the same flight, although this is not always the case. You may ask to play with friends in the
            same or a different flight.
        </p>

        <p>All play is <i></i><b>individual within your flight</b></i></p> with
        prize money awarded in four categories.
        <ul>
            <li>Low Net: Your gross score for 18 holes minus your handicap</li>
            <li>Gross Skins: he single best gross score for each hole</li>
            <li>CTP: Closest to the Pin on all Par 3s</li>
            <li>Low Gross: Optionally, for an additional $5, you can also play for
                Low Gross within your flight.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Pace of play</h2>
        <p>It is our goal to play 18 holes in no more than 4h 15m. Besides this being a
            very reasonable time to play in, the course will have scheduled tee times right behind us.
            If we are slow, then those tee times will not be able to start until our
            last group has passed the 1st tee. So if we are too slow getting past the 1st tee
            too often, we may not be welcome back. </p>

        <h2>Exceptions to USGA Rules of Golf</h2>
        <p>When possible, we try to play by the USGA Rules of Golf. However, as senior golfers,
            and because we want to finish within the 4h 15m goal, some exceptions to those
            rules have been made. There is always some confusion about what those exceptions
            are so please follow this link to the
            <a href="https://www.sites.google.com/view/gomgolf/rules>Rules Exceptions</a>
                        so when the situation arises, you will know what to do.</p>

            or there is a maximum of double par on any hole.
