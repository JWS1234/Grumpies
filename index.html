        <h1>About The Grumpy Old Men</h1>

        <h2>Who We Are</h2>

        <p>The <i>Grumpy Old Men Golf Club</i> was formed
            with the noble goal of getting grumpy senior
            golfers (age 55 or older)
            together twice a week to play golf
            without having to join a club ($$$) or break in with a
            group of golfers of similar age and skill.
        <p></p>
        A small group of volunteers does the grunt work of
        reserving tee times at area courses, collecting entry
        fees, organizing flights, groups, tee times and
        starting hole assignments, analyzing and posting the results,
        and paying out the winners. All the rest of us do is show
        up on time every Monday and Wednesday morning and
        <i><b>TEE IT UP!</b></i> </p>

        <h2>When We Play</h2>
        <p>We play golf every Monday and Wednesday
            throughout the year except when it conflicts with a holiday
            or bad weather. Shotgun tee times are early in the morning
            depending on the time of year - from 7:30 in the summer up
            to 9:00 or later as the days get shorter and the weather
            gets colder. </p>

        <h2>Where We Play</h2>
        <p>Once a week we (usually) play <i> Waterchase Golf Club</i>
            on the east side of Ft Worth.
            We think of Waterchase as our home course.
            On the other day of the week, games are spread across multiple courses in
            Northeast Tarrant County, Eastern Dallas County,
            and Southern Denton County.
            Some of the more popular ones are:</p>
        <ul class="col4">
            <li>Bridlewood, Flower Mound</li>
            <li>Diamond Oaks, Fort Worth</li>
            <li>Fossil Creek, Fort Worth</li>
            <li>Hawks Creek, Westworth Village</li>
            <li>Iron Horse, North Richland Hills</li>
            <li>Irving Golf Club, Irving</li>
            <li>Luna Vista, Dallas</li>
            <li>Mansfield National, Mansfield</li>
            <li>Pecan Valley,Fort Worth</li>
            <li>Riverside, Grand Prairie</li>
            <li>Rockwood, Fort Worth</li>
            <li>Sky Creek Ranch, Keller</li>
            <li>Southern Oaks, Burleson</li>
            <li>Squaw Creek, Willow Park</li>
            <li>Tangle Ridge, Cedar Hill</li>
            <li>Walnut Creek, Mansfield</li>
            <li>Waterchase, Fort Worth></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What We Play</h2>

        <p>We like to think of our golf events as <b>tournaments</b>
            with a minimum $5 entry fee. That $5 goes to an <i>Individual
                Low Net</i> competition within your flight (everything is within
            your flight). Then there are several optional competitions you can get into
            if you're feeling good about your game. We all do, don't we?
            We all think that the next time <i>we'll light it up.</i>
            But you can get away with only a $5 investment. Here are the
            competitons you can enter. If you get into every one,
            it would be $15. They are all within your flight,
            except for the two Hole-in-One competitions - one for a $5 entry fee
            and the other is <i>free.</i>i>.
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>$5 - Low Net (the only one that is not optional)</li>
            <li>$2 - Closest to the Pin on the Par 3 holes.</li>
            <li>$3 - Gross Skins</li>
            <li>$5 - Low Total Gross</li>
            <br>
            <li>Hole-in-One</li>
            <ul>
                <li>$5 - Hole-in-One <br>This would be only after someone makes
                    a Hole-in-One and wins the whole (in one) pot - then it's
                    another $5 if you want to stay in.
                    These sometimes amount to over $1000 - something to think
                    about even if you've never had one.</li>
                <li>Free - Hole-in-one<br>There is <i>another Hole-in-One
                        competition.</i> You don't pay to get into this one - everybody is in.
                    It is funded by taking the "odd dollars" from the other competitions
                    and adding it to this one. For example, if the last $5 in Low Net
                    is shared between two golfers, they each get $2 and the extra
                    $1 goes into this Hole in One fund. Such a deal.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>Based on your handicap, you will be <b>slotted into
            a flight</b> with players that have similar
            handicaps. Flights are typically 12-16 players
            although this may vary depending on the
            number of players signed up. You will play in a
            threesome or foursome,
            usually with players in
            the same flight although this is not always the case.
            You may ask to play with friends who may be in the same or a
            different flight. These flights usually play a set of 
        tees which average around 6000 yards.</p>
        <p> There are also Senior Flights (one or more) which consists
        of players over the age of 80 or, for some other reason, need
        to play the forward (shorter) tees. Total yardage for these 
            flights tends to be around 5000 yards +- 200 yards. 
        </p>
        <h2>Why We Play</h2>
        <p>We're really a <I>great bunch of guys</I> to play golf with, but
            besides that, you get to play some of the best courses in the area without
            having to make your own tee times, organize your own low $$$ event,
            or find friends to play with - you will make
            lots of friends with the
            <i>Grumpy Old Men</i> (we're not really all that grumpy).
        </p>

        <h2>Who Runs the Outfit?</h2>
        <p>We have an excellent staff of permanent officers plus some very
            welcome volunteers.
        <ul>
            <li>President: Tom Moore
            <li>Chairman - Competition Committee: Tom Moore</li>
            <li>Chairman - Membership Committee: Tom Moore</li>
            <li>Chairman - Rules Committee: Tom Moore</li>
            <li>Chairman - I/T Committee: Tom Moore</li>
            <li>Treasurer - Tom Moore</li>
            <li>Chairman - Complaint Committee: Tom says find someone else.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You get the point. We do have a fine group of volunteers
            who meet before each event for one month
            to help with the Sign-In
            process (e.g. they take your money) and then again
            after each event to enter scores into the system
            and whatever else needs doing
            (e.g. they figure out who gets your money).
        </p>

        <h2> Why Not Join Us?</h2>
        <p>Think of it this way. For $0 initiation fee, you can join a club
            with <b>15-20 golf courses</b> where you don't have to make your own tee times
            or find your own low-$ game with people of your own skill level (and age).
            Our green fees average $40 - $50 and competition entry fees from $5 to $15.
