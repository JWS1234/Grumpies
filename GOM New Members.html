    <h2>Golf Matters</h2>
    <p>Let's get right to the important stuff - GOLF.
        The first thing most golfers want to know is more detail about the golf:
        where and when do we play, what are our tee times,
        do we play in flights, who will I play with, what tee boxes do we play,
        what if I don't have a GHIN handicap, are there any special rules
        we play by, and <i>how much does it cost? </i> So let's get to it. </p>

    <h3>Where and When</h3>
    <p>On Monday mornings, we usually play <i>Waterchase Golf Club</i>
        (unless it falls on a holiday or it conflicts with another event).
        Wednesdays we rotate between different courses in the area. While the
        courses may change a bit from year to year, there are some pretty
        reliable ones we count on. If you click on <b>Courses</b> at the top of
        the screen, you will see what other courses we play. If you then click on the
        course name, you will be linked to its website. </p>


    <h3>Tee Times</h3>
    <p>We always have shotgun tee times and tee off early in the morning.
        In the summer that means 7:30. As it gets
        colder and the days get shorter, the tee times may be
        as late as 9:00 or even later
        with very cold weather. The course management may
        impose a <I>frost delay</I> if it deems it necessary to avoid
        damaging the fairways or greens.</p>

    <h3>Flights and Tee Boxes</h3>
    <p>There are nearly 200 <i>official</i> members of <i>The Grumpies.</i>
        Of course not all of them play every week and some who may be on the roles
        may not have played in more than a year.
        We are limited by each course to from 60 to 72 golfers. Sometimes we will
        be able to negotiate for a few more times if a lot of players sign up.
        The actual number that
        play on any given day will depend to a large extent on the weather forecast
        but, except for the weather, we usually come close to (or meet) the limit. </p>

    <p>We play two sets of tees which we refer to as the <i>Back Tees </i>
        and the <i>Forward Tees.</i>
        The Back Tee flights are 1CH (aka Championship),
        A, B, C, and D and are
        usually around 6000 yards (give or take a few hundred yards).
        Anyone can play from the Back tees.
        The Forward Tee flights are F1, F2, and F3, are
        usually around 5000 yards (give or take), and are reserved for
        the <i>super-seniors</i> (age 80+) and others who
        have indicated a need for the shorter course. </p>
    <p>Back tee players are flighted according to their handicap
        and Forward tee players according to their handicap. Back tee
        and Forward tee players are never in the same flight
        (I know - sounds obvious, but ...).</p>

    <h3>Handicaps</h2>
        <p>Golf is one of the few sports that uses handicaps
            (horse racing does sometimes - probably bowling).
            If you are very interested in how
            handicaps are computed, click on Handicaps at the top of the screen
            for an explanation. Otherwise, just accept
            what they tell you your handicap is.</p>

        <p>As a new member, you should know that the handicap you will be
            playing with is based on how you score <b>when
                playing with us.</b> It is <B>not your GHIN handicap</B> which some
            (or many) of you may have if you are a member
            of the USGA and turn your scores in regularly.
            Part of the reason for this is that we have some <i>exceptions to
                the USGA Rules of Golf</i> which would give us a different score
            than if we played strictly by USGA rules. Those are
            explained in the <i>Rules</i> tab. The one exception to this
            is if you have a GHIN handicap when you first join
            the <i>Grumpies</i>, it will be used until you have at least 3 rounds
            played with us. We do, however, compute your handicap
            using the same system that GHIN does (i.e. the World Handicap System
            which the USGA started using in 2020).</p>

        <h3>Rules</h3>
        <p>While we adhere mostly to the <i>USGA Rules of Golf,</i>
            in the interest of more fun and pace of play, there are some
            exceptions. For example, we treat a lost ball or out of bounds
            as a lateral water hazard - take a 1-shot penalty and drop
            near where it was lost or went out of bounds. For more details
            about these excepions, click on the Rules tab at the top of the screen.
        </p>

        <h2>Money Matters</h2>
        <p>What should you expect to pay for all this? It's a bargain!
        <p>

        <h3>Green Fees</h3>

        <p>When you show up at the course the morning of the event,
            you should first go to the pro shop and pay your
            green fee. This is typically between $40 and $50
            including cart and range balls. Waterchase charges
            for range balls but their green fees tend to be a bit lower.
            <i>A tip: when getting range balls at Waterchase, find
                a friend or two and split a small bucket. Their
                definition of small is 40-50 balls.</i>
        </p>

        <h3>Event Fees</h3>

        <p>When you play in a Grumpy event, you are on the hook for at
            least $5 for <I>Place Money</I> - Low Net within your
            flight (usually 5 or 6 places depending on the size of your flight).
            You may optionally elect to participate in
            some side bets including Low Gross ($5), Gross Skins ($3),
            and Closest to the Pin ($2). Everything is within
            your flight. See <i>Event Format</i> for more information. </p>

        <h3>Hole-in-One Fee</h3>
        <p>Again, optionally, you may join the <i>Hole-in-One Club </i>
            by paying a $5 fee which is held in the Hole-in-One Pot
            until someone gets (you guessed it) a hole-in-one, at which time the
            lucky (or good?) golfer collects the balance in the pot
            and you get to decide whether to pay another $5 for the
            next hole-in-one. The payout for this contest is often
            over $1000. </p>
        <p>There is a second Hole-in-One opportunity which is free.
            It is funded by "left-over prize money" from the other
            competitions. Again, look at Event Format for more
            details about this <i>freebie.</i>
        </p>


        <h2>Signing Up</h2>
        <p>Of course, to take advantage of all this good stuff, you have
            to first sign up. The <I>Calendar</I> tab shows the schedule
            of events for as far out as is known. In the calendar is a
            <I>Status</I> field which, if it says <b>OPEN,</b> means you
            can sign up. There is a <b>limit</b> on the number of tee
            times a course will reserve for us and, multiplied by 4,
            determines the maximum number of players that can sign up. Our
            <I>Calendar</I> shows what the limit is for each scheduled
            event and how many are currently signed up. If the status is FULL,
            you can still sign up and be put on the waiting list in case
            someone cancels or we are able to get more tee times.
        </p>
        <p>
            <font color="red">There is a field in the Calendar which,
                if you want to sign
                up, you click on this field and it will generate an email message
                to Grumpy headquarters with your request.</font>
        </p>

        <h3>Every Monday/Wednesday Players</h3>
        <p>The Grumpy staff maintains a list of players who have indicated
            their intention to play every Monday and/or every Wednesday.
            These players will be pre-registered for those
            events without having to go through the regular sign-up
            process. It is their responsibility to withdraw if they
            do not intend to play that day. When you look at the
            Calendar, it may show FULL several weeks ahead of the
            tournament. This is because of the <i>Everies.</i>
            Don't let this deter you from signing up and going on Wait List
            as many <i>Everies</i> often cancel before the tournament.</p>

        <h2>Signing In</h2>

        <p>You sign in the morning of the event at the golf course.
            Go to the Pro Shop and pay your green fee and then find
            our table (usually in the dining area) and finish the
            sign-in process by paying your entry fee(s) and finding
            out what foursome you are in and what your starting hole
            assignment is. </p>

        <p style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-size: larger" </style>
            Please be there at least 15 minutes before your tee time.</p>

        <p>You're all set. Go to the range, the putting green,
            the chipping green, and get ready for a great day.
            Just don't miss your tee time. If you do not know the
            people you are playing with, take this opportunity to find
            them, find your cart, and decide who will be the driver and
            who will be the passenger.
        <p>

        <h2>Start Your Engines</h2>
        <p>You and your cart partner should head for your starting
            hole in time to make your tee time. When your entire group is
            there, then go ahead and tee off (but not too early). Two players
            in different carts should keep
            score and the cards reconciled before turning in your
            score in the pro shop (they will have a place for you to
            drop off your card). You will usually get the results later
            that same day or the next. If you won any money, you can collect it
            the next time you play.</p>

        <p class="Bluebox">Welcome to the Grumpies and Good Golfing!!!</p>
