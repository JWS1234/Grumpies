<h2 id="pace" class="smallbox">Pace of Play</h2>

<p>Nobody likes to wait 15 minutes to hit their next shot, or play a round
    in a speedy 5 hours. You don't have to be a scratch golfer to play
    quickly - you just have to follow a few guidelines to save lots of time.
    The following are some tips on how to maintain a 4:15 pace.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Play ready golf!</b> <br>This is probably the most violated rule when
        it comes to maintaining a good pace of play. Too many golfers
        insist on waiting until they are <b>away</b>> before
        they hit their next shot. If you ar in the way of another golfer,
        by all means wait, but if you are not always
        but can hit your next shot without interfering with someone else,
        do it. This is true on the tee box, in the fairway or rough, and
        on the putting green. If you are 20 feet from the pin and your playing
        partner is 21 feet but is raking the trap, go ahead and putt -
        don't wait for him to finish raking. </li>
    <li><b>Continuous putting!</b> <br>Another practice often violated.
        If you miss your first putt, finish putting out if you are not
        in the line of someone else. Most of the greens we play
        tend to be very hard and even if you step in someone else's
        line, you are not likely to make a dent in the green.</li>
    <li><b>Keep your clubs handy!</b><br>When you walk up to the green
        with several clubs, lay everything but the putter where you
        can pick it up on the way off the green - i.e. between
        you and the cart. Don't leave them on the other side of
        the green where you have to chase after them when you are
        done putting.
    <li><b>Keep score on the next tee!</b><br>Don't stand aroung the
        green asking everybody what they shot on that hole and
        writing it down on the score card. Get in your cart and go
        to the next tee and then write down the scores. </li>
    <li><b>Ignore honors!</b><br>This isn't the US Amateur.
        When you get to the next tee box, go ahead and hit even
        if you just got a 10 on the previous hole. This is a
        corollary of ready golf.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="handicaps">Your Handicap</h2>
<details>
    <summary>
        <p>In almost every amateur golf competition, your HANDICAP
            plays a role in whether you win or lose.
            Handicaps come into play in two ways. Handicaps have been
            around (I have read) since the 17th century
            in Scotland. Perhaps the earliest form of handicapping was
            referred to as "First Tee Negotiation."
    </summary>
    <p>Handicaps come into play in two ways.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Your handicap is subtracted from your 18-hole <b><i>Gross Score</i></b>
            (what you actually shoot on the course with no adjustments)
            to give you a <b><i>Net Score </i></b>
            (an adjustment recognizing the skill differences
            between two or more players).
            Net score is what most amateur club tournaments use to
            determine winners, with the obvious
            exception of tournaments like Club Championships. Even
            these tournaments usually have a major component
            based
            on Net Scores. Without them, most of us could not compete.
        </li>

        <li>Sometimes handicaps are applied to individual holes in
            addition to the 18-hole total.
            On the score card, every hole has a handicap rating from 1 to 18 to
            indicate the difficulty of that hole, with the #1 handicap
            hole being the most difficult
            (not exacly true but close enough for this discussion).
            If you have a 12 handicap and the hole is rated as the #8
            handicap hole, you get a stoke on that hole, so if you shot a 5
            then your Net Score on that hole would be 4.
            If the hole is rated as a 14, you do not get a stroke and
            your net score remains a 5.
            In competition, this hole by hole competition is referred to as
            Net Skins. Gross Skins are the same except
            without handicaps - a 5 is a 5. Basically there are 18 1-hole
            competitions within an 18 hole tournament in addition to the
            18-hole Net (or Gross) Score competition.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The mystery of a handicap is primarily in the language used
        to explain it. Course Rating,
        Course Slope, Adjusted Gross Score, Score Differentials, and
        Index are all used to
        determine your handicap.
        Prior to 2020, there were as many as 6 different handicap
        systems in use around the world,
        with the USGA and the R&A (Royal and Ancient) being the most prominent.
        In 2020 they got together and
        had a meeting of the minds and created the <b>World Handicap
            System (WHS)</b> so that now all golfers worldwide
        have a common process for
        calculating handicaps making it more fair for everybody. It also
    </p>
    <p>Very few golfers really know how handicaps are determined -
        only that it is a reflection of their own
        skill level. The lower your handicap,
        he better golfer you (probably) are. With that in mind,
        the following is an explanation of the terms used to
        describe the handicapping process.
        The first two (Course Rating and Slope) quantify
        the difficulty of the course for both the scratch
        golfer and the bogey golfer. </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Course Rating (CR): </b> This is a number that
            represents what a scratch golfer
            should expect to shoot on average over a period of time.
            It is usually
            within a few shots of par (e.g. 73.2 for a difficult
            Par 72 course or 69.4 for an easier
            par 72 course). A key point here is that <b>it is
                based on what the scratch golfer
                should expect to shoot.</b> The course rating
            will be different for each set of tees
            and is usually found on the score card.</li>

        <li><b>Course Slope (CS):</b> Slope was added to the formula
            by the USGA in 1987 to account
            for the difficulty of a golf course for the bogey golfer
            (e.g. an 18 handicapper).
            It is a number between 55 and 155 with 113 meaning the
            same degree of difficulty
            for scratch and bogey golfers. The higher the slope,
            the more the course favors
            the scratch golfer (e.g. more hazards to avoid).
            The lower the slope the more it favors
            the bogey golfer (e.g. not so much trouble to avoid).
            Like course rating,
            the slope is different for each set of tees and is usually
            found on the score card along with the course rating.</li>

        <li><b>Adjusted Gross Score (AGS):</b> In 2020, when the
            WHS was created, the powers that be
            made a change to the maximum score a golfer could count
            on a hole <b>for handicap purposes.</b>
            Without going into the details of what it was before 2020,
            it is now a
            <b>net double bogey.</b> For example, if you get a 10 on a
            par 5 hole and get one shot,
            on that hole an 8 would give you a net double of 7. So,
            for handicap purposes, the most you can count on that hole
            is 8. You still
            have to count the 10 for every other purpose. Your adjusted
            gross score is now two shots
            less than the score recorded on your score card. For
            Grumpy Old Men, you don't have to make this adjustmemt,
            the handicapping sytstem does
            that for you when your hole by hole scores are entered
            into the system.
        </li>

        <li><b>Score Differential:</b> Simply put, this is the
            difference between your <b>adjusted
                gross score</b> and the<b> course rating (AGS - CR).</b>
            For example, if the course
            rating is 71.6 and your
            adjusted gross score is 86, the differential
            is 86&nbsp;-&nbsp;71.6&nbsp;=&nbsp;14.4. As
            you will see, these score differentials are part of the equation
            for calculating your
            Index which is part of the calculation for Course Handicap. </li>

        <li><b>Index:</b> This is the last number to be determined before
            calculating your course
            handicap. It's simple to calculate. For now, let's assume
            that you have entered 20
            or more adjusted gross scores into the handicap system.
            There will be a Score Differential
            for each of these scores (e.g. 14.4). Your index is
            the <b>average of the best (lowest) 8
                score differentials</b> from your most recent 20 scores.
            <p>Why do we need an Index? Because it is <b><i>portable.</i></b>
                It is an indication of
                your golfing ability on easy or difficult courses.
                You can go to other courses
                and calculate your handicap based on the difficulty of that course.</p>
        </li>

        <li><b>Course Handicap (CH):</b> FINALLY we get to what we all
            (or at least some of us I hope)
            wanted to know - how your course handicap is really determined.
            It all comes down to this
            formula: </li>
        <p class="bluebox"> CH = [(Index * Slope) / 113] + (CR - PAR). </p>
